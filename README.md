# 👋 Hey there! I’m @jonapellet (a.k.a. Jonathan Pelletier)

### 🌐 Cloud Whisperer | 🛠 Tech Builder | 🤖 AI Enthusiast

Located in *Longueuil, Québec*, I've spent years navigating the vast skies of cloud technology, teaching machines to learn, and coding solutions that make life a tad easier for everyone. When I'm not architecting cloud infrastructures or crunching big data sets, you might catch me experimenting with the latest AI trends or cycling around Québec's picturesque landscapes.

- 👀 **What piques my interest?** Anything cloud and AI! From deploying intricate AWS architectures to refining AI models for fun projects like creating an image dataset handler with Python and Tensorflow.

- 🌱 **What’s my latest learning adventure?** Currently getting my hands dirty with GCP and Azure to master the trifecta of cloud platforms. Because why stop at AWS, right?

- 💞️ **Looking to collaborate?** If you’re navigating the cloud computing realm, keen on AI, or have an idea to make the digital world a better place, I'm your guy! 

- 📫 **Let’s connect!** The best way to reach me is through my email: jonathan.pelletier-aafz@thecloudco.ca.
